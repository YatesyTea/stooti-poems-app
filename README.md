This small project uses Svelte + Vite to deploy on Vercel.

This project required a cleaned file of poems which has been source from Kaggle, and then cleaned by myself with some basic python scripts.

All that's required to run this is to git clone, npm install, npm run dev -- --open and it will run on port:5173 by default.

Consideration for running server-side caching and requests are in the works, however will require a server setup within the application (which was made in an afternoon initially).

Thanks for reading; and I hope you enjoy.
